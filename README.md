# React Learning Lab 🚀

An advanced study repository focused on **React + TypeScript**, emphasizing **best practices**, **architecture**, **performance**, **testing**, and **code quality**.

This project was created to **consolidate React knowledge in a progressive and practical way**, using **evolutionary modules** built inside a **single React application**.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

- Review and deepen fundamental and advanced React concepts
- Apply real-world frontend architecture patterns
- Evolve a single domain incrementally
- Build a project that can be used as a **technical reference and portfolio**
- Document architectural decisions and learnings clearly

---

## 🧠 Core Concept

- ✅ Single repository
- ✅ Single React application
- ✅ Incremental modules
- ✅ Accumulative codebase
- ✅ Clear evolution history

Each module **adds new responsibilities and concepts** without discarding previous ones.
